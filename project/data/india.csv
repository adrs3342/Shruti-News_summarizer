The two parties accused the central government of overlooking the state’s critical demands.Vijayan, Balagopal, and Leader of Opposition V D Satheesan expressed their disappointment, claiming that key state demands—including a Rs 24,000 crore special financial package and rehabilitation aid for Wayanad—had been ignored in the budget. The trio described the budget as ""condemnable,"" ""extremely disappointing,"" and ""unfortunate.""The CPI(M) quickly responded, condemning both the Union Budget, presented by Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, and Kurian’s comments. CPI(M) State Secretary M V Govindan and senior leader E P Jayarajan accused Kurian of adopting an “anti-Kerala” stance in the allocation of funds to the state.The CPI(M) intensified its criticism, alleging that the BJP-led Centre had deliberately sidelined Kerala in the budget, pushing what they termed an “anti-Kerala” agenda. Govindan claimed that despite Kerala’s strong performance in human development, health, and education, the BJP had consistently worked against the state’s interests.“The BJP’s aim is to make Kerala poor and backward. After their failed attempts to tighten their grip on the state, they are now trying to push Kerala backward by denying it the funds it deserves,” Govindan said.Echoing these views, Jayarajan accused the Centre of political discrimination in fund allocations, violating federal principles, and undermining secular values. He called for a united Kerala to protest against Kurian's statement, urging the Centre to recognize India as a united nation where all states are treated equally.“The people of Kerala must unite and protest against the Union minister’s statement that the state must regress in all areas of development to receive central allocations,” Jayarajan said.This criticism follows earlier claims from Kerala’s leadership that the state’s key demands—such as the special financial package and Wayanad rehabilitation aid—were disregarded in the Union Budget.","Kurian’s comments come amid strong criticism of the Union Budget 2025-26 by both the ruling CPI(M) and opposition Congress in Kerala.

Government’s debt management plan

Capital expenditure and growth focus

NEW DELHI: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Sunday cited India’s “unblemished track record” of fiscal consolidation , even as credit rating agency Moody’s decided not to upgrade the country’s sovereign rating.Sitharaman said that India has never deviated from its fiscal consolidation and debt reduction targets.She also defended the government’s strategy of balancing fiscal prudence with growth, highlighting tax reliefs and a clear debt management plan outlined in the Union Budget for 2024-25.""Despite all these we have shown a commitment and following the commitment to the last word as regards fiscal deficit and the glide path that we should follow,"" Sitharaman said. ""We have, not one year have we failed (to meet our commitment).""Global credit rating agency Moody’s has maintained India’s sovereign rating at “Baa3” with a stable outlook, the lowest investment-grade rating. The agency ruled out an immediate upgrade, citing concerns over the country’s debt burden and fiscal deficit levels.""While we view the government's sustained fiscal discipline and narrower fiscal deficits as credit positive, we don't expect these improvements in the debt burden or 'debt affordability' to be enough to trigger a sovereign rating upgrade at this time,"" Christian de Guzman, Senior Vice President at Moody’s Ratings, told PTI.Moody’s evaluates a country’s creditworthiness, assessing its ability to repay debt. A higher rating generally translates to lower borrowing costs and increased investor confidence, while a lower rating signals higher risks.Sitharaman stressed that India had to borrow more during the Covid-19 pandemic due to global supply chain disruptions and geopolitical conflicts but has remained committed to reducing debt levels.""The government has volunteered to say that it will manage the debt,"" she said, adding that India has been steadily working towards reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio in line with expert recommendations.She also highlighted that while focusing on fiscal discipline, there has been no reduction in public spending on essential sectors such as social welfare, education, and healthcare.She defended the government’s approach to capital expenditure , which has been pegged at Rs11.21 lakh crore for 2024-25, a modest increase from Rs 10.18 lakh crore in the revised estimate for the current fiscal year.""If we are looking at the numbers, because we've got used to 16 per cent, 17 per cent increase (in capital spending) every year from 2020, and saying you have not increased it by that number (in the Budget for 2025-26), I would equally want to ask you to please look at the way in which the quality of spending has happened, particularly capital expenditure,"" she stated.Sitharaman also praised states for effectively utilising the 50-year interest-free loans provided for capital expenditure, contributing to overall infrastructure growth.The spending for the ongoing fiscal was lower than initially budgeted due to a slowdown in expenditure during the general election period.

Will faith 'trump' uncertainty? 'Visa temples' give hope to H1-B applicants,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-faith-trump-uncertainty-visa-temples-give-hope-to-h1-b-applicants/articleshow/117841961.cms,"Ashok Sundar had just struck out '108' on the little chequered sheet standing inside the Chilkur Balaji temple - 20km from Hyderabad's skyscraper-studded Financial District. His beaming face, glossy polyester shirt and bright red vermilion tilak running right up to the hairline meant that the ""visa god"" had smiled upon him. Ashok got his passport stamped with H-1B a day earlier and was at the temple to show his gratitude.He leaves for his new tech job in New Jersey in April.There were many Ashoks in the sea of people chanting 'Govinda, Govinda' as they walked around the deity at the temple, less than a fortnight after Donald Trump took over as the 47th President of the US. Since taking office, Trump has threatened to send back ""millions and millions of criminal aliens"", send troops to the southern border, and has even ordered the revoking of citizenship status for children of temporary visa holders. The announcements have sent a chill down the spine of the immigrant community, both within the US and among those anxious to go there.Indians dreaming of a new life in the US are now clinging to faith in the hope of a miracle - whether it is the Chilkur Balaji temple near Hyderabad, the Chamatkari Hanuman temple at Ahmedabad or the Shree Siddhi Peeth Chamatkari Hanuman Mandir in Delhi. ""Eleven of us had applied last year,"" says Ashok, after completing his 108th pradakshina (circumambulation) of the temple dedicated to an avatar of Vishnu. ""I am the only one who got the visa. It is only because of Lord Balaji,"" adds the IT executive. He had prayed at the temple after submitting his visa papers in June 2024.Ahmedabad's Chamatkari Hanuman temple, also called 'Visa Hanuman', has swelling crowds during the weekend, with just two prayers on their lips. Either it's ""Lord, please grant me a visa"" or it's ""Lord, thank you for the visa."" The 300-year-old temple has earned a ""visa friendly"" reputation, drawing devotees from as far as J&K and Meghalaya.Pujari Vijay Bhatt says a person wishing to get a visa is first asked to place his or her passport before Lord Hanuman and then repeat the Hanuman Chalisa after the pujari. The applicant is also asked to visit any Hanuman temple once a week and repeat the Hanuman Chalisa. ""It's all about one's 'shraddha'. If there is faith, all things are possible. If doubts creep into one's mind, then one is bound to face disappointment,"" says the priest, adding that he has been witness to instances where a visa has been secured within an hour of conducting the ritual, even after three or four visa denials. One such Ahmedabad resident whose US visa has been rejected once, got to know from friends that praying at the Chamatkari Hanuman temple will work wonders. ""I have complete faith that I will be granted a US visa in my next interview,"" he says, before going through the temple rituals.Down a dusty lane filled with hardware shops stands the Shree Siddhi Peeth Chamatkari Hanuman Mandir at Delhi's Neb Sarai. Pandit Narayan Mishra, who has been officiating at the mandir for the last five years, says people give up meat, alcohol, onion and garlic for 41 days in their quest for the elusive visa stamp. ""They write their manokamna (wish) on a piece of paper. We take the slip of paper and make the idol 'read it' and chant the mantras. It is then placed in a box next to the deity,"" Mishra says.But what makes people come from across the country to the temple? ""Perhaps because Hanuman is considered the first god to have travelled outside the country to Lanka without any paperwork,"" he adds with a smile. Folklore or an attempt at humour, people in the area attest to the ""magical powers"" of the shrine. ""People come in a very disturbed state of mind. This is their last resort, and we usually find that their wishes do come true. Just last week, an applicant who got his US visa in only two weeks came to the temple for a puja to thank God,"" shares Mishra.Though Andhra software engineer Chandana C confesses to being crestfallen after Trump's success in the elections, she is now hopeful that her 25 visits to the Hyderabad temple in the last 25 months will not go in vain. ""I have been coming here every month since I applied for the visa through a local consultancy. I know things aren't looking bright right now, but I have faith I will eventually get it,"" says the 26-year-old desperate to realise her American dream, just like all her other relatives did.Not just for themselves, some even go through the ritual motions for their beloved kin. Kaushik R, on his 56th pradakshina, says that he is there to pray for his older brother living in North Carolina. ""I am praying that his name is selected in the lottery process, and he gets his H-1B. If all goes well, I will also join the University of Cincinnati for a MS programme later this year,"" says the freshly-minted engineering graduate - pinning his hopes on his talent and Lord Balaji in equal measure. ""But I will pray for myself later. This is for my brother,"" Kaushik adds, before quickly returning to his place in the queue. Right behind him is Ravindra R, who has landed himself his dream job in Texas. There's just one step for him to clear now: the visa interview. ""When I go for it, I know I will have Lord Balaji's blessings with me. Nothing can stop me,"" the IT professional says.With additional reporting from Meghdoot Sharon in Ahmedabad(Applicants' names changed on request)","Ashok Sundar got his passport stamped with H-1B a day earlier and was at the temple to show his gratitude.

In the early hours of Wednesday, as thousands of pilgrims gathered at Triveni Sangam in Prayagraj for a sacred bath, a surge of young men tore through the crowd, trampling sleeping devotees and those huddled near the ghat, recounted survivors and eyewitnesses. When the dust settled, 30 lay dead - most of them women.It began around 1am. Barricades gave way under the force of the crowd, and in the mad rush towards the river, those who had been waiting patiently for dawn were crushed underfoot, reports Arvind Chauhan. ""The crowd came like a tornado,"" said Maul Devi, a survivor from eastern UP. ""Most of them were young men running towards Sangam. There was no control, only mayhem. I fell twice with my sister, holding onto her hand as tightly as I could. But then the weight of the falling men broke us apart. She was crushed to death in front of my eyes."" Further down, people jostled and pushed each other for every inch after midnight. But a different warning had sparked panic.Police, perhaps fearing overcrowding, ordered pilgrims to take their dip immediately instead of waiting for dawn. ""Around midnight, we were resting a few hundred metres from Sangam. Suddenly, cops asked us to take a dip immediately,"" said Laxmi, who came from Chhatrapur in MP with her family. ""We were preparing when a wave of people came running towards us, and everyone was trampled. After that, police were missing. I lost my sister-in-law,"" she said.The bottleneck of movement only made things worse. Gudiya Pandey from Auraiya in UP described how a single open lane forced pilgrims into a narrow, choking space. ""I was pulled from a pile of bodies by some boys who helped me and others escape,"" she said.For some, the horror went beyond loss. A family from Maharashtra spoke of how their women were caught in the stampede. ""When my mother was rescued, her clothes were gone. She had just stepped out of the water when the crowd fell on her,"" a survivor said. Others, lucky to escape with their lives, abandoned their pilgrimage altogether. Sanjay Kumar Mandal, who came from Dhanbad in Jharkhand with his family, said: ""We were injured but managed to get up and escape. We didn't take the dip. We're going home.""By morning, the river still flowed, the sun still rose, and prayers still echoed.

Pannun used Sikhs for Justice role as cover to inflict war on India: Tribunal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pannun-used-sfj-role-as-cover-to-inflict-war-on-india-tribunal/articleshow/117790552.cms,"NEW DELHI: Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), banned as an “unlawful association” under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act , is a frontal organisation of Gurpatwant Singh Pannun , who as the outfit’s legal adviser is using his “juristic identity” as a cover to perpetrate war upon India in league with other agencies and state-and non-state actors of foreign countries, a tribunal led by Justice Anoop Kumar Mendiratta ruled while upholding the ban on the pro-Khalistani outfit earlier this month.The background note submitted by the government to the tribunal, detailing the activities of SFJ, states that the all activities of the outfit are usually carried out from offices of Pannun, an attempt on whose life in the US, allegedly involving a former Indian government officer, had become an irritant in Indo-US tied until they agreed to cooperate on the case, with a panel set up by India recently recommending “legal action” against the “individual”.The government of India’s background note on SFJ and Pannun, submitted before the tribunal, records that the outfit has repeatedly threatened India’s political leaders, government officers including the police, diplomats, judiciary and even their family members and families abroad. These include Prime Minister Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah, external affairs minister S Jaishankar, chief minister and minister of Punjab, national security adviser, and RAW chief. The note reveals that SFJ organises protests and filing of baseless cases against visiting Indian dignitaries abroad, particularly in Europe, Canada and US, to defame them and to fan anti-India sentiments among the Sikh diaspora.Stating that SFJ has been organising anti-India protests outside Indian embassies or consulates, where its activists have raised Khalistan flags and even dishonoured the Indian flag and indulged in violence and vandalisation of the premises, the documents filed with the tribunal reveal that many of the protests had the active support of Pakistani missions and were in tandem with multiple ISI-backed Pakistani diaspora outfits and Kashmiri diaspora. They also said Hindu temples in Canada and Australia were defaced with Khalistani graffiti and ISIS exhorted by SFJ after the deadly ISIS attack on Gurdwara Kart-e-Parwan in Kabul, Afghanistan, to target the Indian embassies rather than gurdwaras.The note directly names Pannun for having instigated the Indian farmers protesting against the three farm bills to arm themselves and fight against the Indian forces with weapons that would reach them from across the border (Pakistan). It said he has conspired with other Khalistani leaders like UK-based Babbar Khalsa International leader Paramjit Singh Pamma as well as Canada based terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, who was shot dead in 2023, to revive terrorism in Punjab.SFJ, according to the government’s submission, has been inciting Sikh personnel to desert the Army and police forces. He had urged Sikh Soldiers to join the SFJ movement and offered them Rs 5000 more than the salary given by the Indian government. He also tried to provoke the Sikh soldiers posted in Ladakh to not to fight for India against Chinese aggression.SFJ has also been colluding with the gangsters, terrorists and other radical elements including Kashmir separatists. Not only this, it has been inciting non-Sikh communities including Muslims and Tamils, as also Christians in Manipur to secede from India.As many as 104 cases have been registered against SFJ elements, including 96 by various state police and 8 by NIA.“Vitriolic speeches made by Gurpatwant Singh Pannun glorifying militants such as Bhinderwalan & Nijjar, making calls to assassinate Constitutional functionaries of the country, calling for a referendum which is nothing but a plebiscite, taken jointly or individually... constitute “sufficient cause” for confirming the decision of the Union of India to extend the declaration of SFJ as unlawful association for a further period of five years,” the tribunal stated while upholding the ban on January 3 this year.","Sikhs for Justice (SFJ) banned as an “unlawful association’ under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act.

I struggled to make the request to the CJI,” he said.Apart from his legal acumen, he was known for his lighter vein comments to diffuse tense debates inside the courtroom, especially in sensitive and important issues before constitution benches. So much so that, CJI D Y Chandrachud always gave him the opportunity to speak the last word, which invariably was a joke rhyming with the issue.CJI Khanna modified Sibal’s statement that Justice Roy was a complete judge. The CJi said Justice Roy was a complete man, as apart from legal knowledge, reasonableness and a sense of justice, he was an allrounder being a voracious reader and golfer.

Increased Public Awareness and Education Improved Surveillance and Detection

MUMBAI: As 18 of 140 patients with the debilitating neurological disorder, Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS), are on ventilator support in Pune, there is some cold comfort in knowing this isn't the worst outbreak in the world - yet. It could, however, be considered one of the largest GBS outbreaks as medical literature classified 30 to 50 cases as an outbreak until 2019 when Peru registered the worst flare-up.The South American country had 1,120 cases in 2019, with 683 cases reported in two months.Its annual caseload stood at 59 in 2017 and rose to 262 in 2018 before peaking in 2019. Cases were recorded from across the country, but there is little data on deaths. The story didn't end there; Peru witnessed an outbreak again in 2023, when 130 suspected cases were reported between June 10 and July 15.The problem with GBS, as a professor of medicine in a medical college in Mumbai said, is that it is an autoimmune condition that technically doesn't seem like an epidemic-causing condition. ""GBS has been seen as an independent disorder that is sporadically seen across the country, but we now need to change our mindset and accept it can emerge as an outbreak and study it epidemiologically to look for links between the patients,"" he said.The only link between Peru and Pune is microbe Campylobacter jejuni . Smaller studies from across the world show GBS following this infection is linked with higher disability and mortality rates.GBS has been so rare - India has a reported annual incidence of 1.75 to 2 per lakh population - that there are few in-depth studies. The first-ever detailed analysis of the prevalence and disability burden of GBS was conducted in 2021. Using data between 1990 and 2019, the analysis showed that Japan, Brunei Darussalam, Singapore, South Korea, the US and Mexico had much higher than expected burdens, while countries and territories such as China, Fiji, Taiwan, and Guam had much lower than expected burdens.","18 of 140 patients with the debilitating neurological disorder, Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS), are on ventilator support in Pune.

PUNE/GUWAHATI: Maharashtra reported its fifth death linked to Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) and Assam its first on Saturday as a continued uptick in hospitalisations across Pune took the metropolitan region's caseload to 149, up by nine overnight.A 60-year-old man from Nanded Gaon treated at Pune's Sassoon Hospital since Jan 16 died around 12.30am, hours before a 17-year-old girl admitted to Guwahati's privately-run Pratiksha Hospital on Jan 21 became the first confirmed GBS death outside Maharashtra since the outbreak there.The teenager was on ventilator support for 11 days.Two suspected GBS casualties in Kolkata last week - both boys, 10 and 17 - are still to be officially confirmed.Concern over the Pune cluster's continued growth was exacerbated by an increase in the number of patients in a critical condition. Health department data showed ICU admissions spiking from 45 until Friday to 83. The number of patients on ventilator support stood at 28, up from 18 the previous day.This was offset by some encouraging news in the form of hospitals discharging 38 GBS patients. GBS, which triggers a range of challenging but treatable neurological and other complications, generally doesn't occur in clusters like the one in Pune.The city's latest casualty in the outbreak succumbed to respiratory failure with autonomic dysfunction and quadriplegia - both complications arising from GBS - along with hypertension, an official at Sassoon Hospital said. ""The patient was from Khadakwasla, one of the areas in Nanded Gaon that has reported several GBS cases. He had diarrhoea for seven days before coming to the hospital. By the time he arrived, he was in a critical condition with quadriplegia (paralysis of the arms and legs),"" the official said.The deceased had sought treatment at smaller hospitals before coming to Sassoon in a critical condition.BJ Medical College and Sassoon Hospital's dean, Dr Eknath Pawar, said, ""We discharged five GBS patients on Saturday. Sassoon has 27 GBS patients. Over the next 2-3 days, another 10 patients are likely to be discharged.""Villages newly added to the Pune Municipal Corporation belt have been affected the most, accounting for 82 GBS cases so far. Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation has 17 patients.The search for what triggered the outbreak hit a hurdle when water samples tested for Campylobacter jejuni, found in stool samples of at least five patients, were found free of the bacterium. On Friday, 15 samples collected from private tankers that supply water to neighbourhoods reporting GBS cases were found to have high levels of coliform and E. coli contamination. Fourteen of the samples tested positive for E.coli, with counts exceeding 16 per 100ml. Safe drinking water should ideally have zero E.coli.","M Maharashtra reported its fifth death linked to Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) and Assam its first on Saturday.

Army gearing up to induct more heavy-duty drones,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/army-gearing-up-to-induct-more-heavy-duty-drones/articleshow/117847274.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Army is chalking out a long-term roadmap to expand its fleet of heavy-duty drones for ISR (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance) as well as precision-strike missions, with their sheer operational utility being reinforced by the Russia-Ukraine and Armenia-Azerbaijan conflicts amid the ongoing shift towards unmanned and autonomous technologies in modern warfare.The force is basically looking at unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and remotely-piloted aircraft (RPA) systems that can operate at ranges beyond 1,000-km for long-range strategic ISR missions, fly at altitudes over 30,000-feet to evade detection, and have an endurance of over 24 hours at a stretch, top sources told TOI on Thursday.As per estimates, China has well over 2,000 top-notch UAVs, which includes combat drones like the Cai Hong-4, CH-5, CH-7, Wing Loong-II and the stealthy Hongdu GJ-11 `Sharp Sword’.China is also the world’s largest exporter of military UAVs , and has stepped up supply of the armed CH-4 and Wing Loong-II drones to Pakistan, which in turn has around 150-200 drones, including the Turkish Bayraktar TB2 and Akinci drones.The Indian Army, in contrast, has only around 50 Israeli-origin Heron Mark-I and Mark-II as well as Searcher-II medium-altitude long-endurance (MALE) drones. Amid the military standoff with China, the force inducted four new satcom-enabled Heron Mark-II drones to boost surveillance along the Line of Actual Control.While the Army Aviation Corps operates these fighter-size UAVs for surveillance and precision-targeting, infantry battalions use a wide array of smaller drones for tactical reconnaissance, logistics and other tasks.While IAF and Navy have their own UAV fleets, there is an overall requirement of at least 150 new MALE drones for the three Services. Towards this end, the Army is focusing on indigenous development of MALE drones by DRDO as well as private sector companies, including through collaboration with friendly countries.DRDO has developed the Rustom series of UAVs, including the Tapas-BH-201 drone but it failed to fully meet operational military requirements, as was first reported by TOI. “Efforts are now underway to enhance the capabilities of Tapas,” a source said.The first flight of Archer-NG, a weaponised MALE drone developed by DRDO, in turn, is expected soon. With a maximum altitude of 30,000-feet, the UAV can carry 300 kg of payload, including anti-tank guided missiles and smart anti-airfield weapons. “With a 1,000-km range, Archer-NG is designed for ISR missions, target acquisition and precision-strikes,” he added.In the arena of the much more capable high-altitude, long endurance (HALE) drones, the armed forces of course will get 31 armed MQ-9B `Predators’ under the Rs 32,350 crore contract inked with the US last Oct. The delivery of these drones, armed with Hellfire missiles, GBU-39B precision-guided glide bombs and other weapons, will begin in 2029.“The Army also needs advanced MALE drones because of the two long `active’ borders with China and Pakistan, both of which require continuous real-time intelligence-gathering and monitoring,” another source said.“UAVs and RPA systems reduce risk to soldiers, allow longer operational endurance and provide precision-strike capabilities. They also enhance counter-terrorism operations by tracking cross-border infiltrations and carrying out strikes on terrorist hideouts,” he added.","The Army is chalking out a long-term roadmap to expand its fleet of heavy-duty drones for ISR as well as precision-strike missions.

NEW DELHI: Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Sunday outlined India’s economic trajectory, fiscal policies, and key government initiatives after she presented the 8th consecutive union budget a day earlier.Sitharaman reaffirmed the Centre’s commitment to fiscal consolidation while ensuring economic growth, infrastructure expansion, and sectoral support. Addressing global economic challenges, she detailed strategies to navigate uncertainties and sustain momentum.The finance minister said that the new tax regime aims to provide relief to taxpayers across the board.""This tax proposal will make people have more money in their hands. When people have money in their hands, they make their judgment about whether they want to spend it entirely or spend some out of it and also make sure that they save something else some amount from it,"" she said. The minister highlighted that the revised tax slabs were designed to flow smoothly and predictably, making taxation more straightforward for citizens.In an interview to news agency PTI, Sitharaman stated that India remains the fastest-growing major economy, driven by robust domestic consumption and government-led capital expenditure. Despite global uncertainties, she emphasised that India is well-positioned to maintain its growth trajectory.She highlighted fiscal prudence as a priority, with the government aiming to reduce the fiscal deficit to below 4.5% of GDP by 2025-26. Balancing capital investments with fiscal discipline is essential to ensuring financial stability while fostering expansion.Acknowledging global headwinds such as geopolitical tensions, supply chain disruptions, and inflationary pressures, Sitharaman stressed that India’s diversified economy and policy measures have helped cushion external shocks. She noted that despite slowing global trade, India’s exports remain resilient, with efforts underway to strengthen trade partnerships and reduce dependence on specific markets.Sitharaman defended India’s fiscal discipline and commitment to debt reduction, stating, “Despite all these (challenges), we have shown a commitment and followed the commitment to the last word as regards fiscal deficit and the glide path that we should follow. We have, not one year, failed (to meet our commitment).”She acknowledged that India had to borrow more during the pandemic to address fiscal needs but insisted that the government has adhered strictly to fiscal consolidation targets.Moody’s Ratings, however, ruled out an immediate upgrade of India’s sovereign rating. Christian de Guzman, Senior Vice President at Moody’s, stated, “While we view the government's sustained fiscal discipline and narrower fiscal deficits as credit positive, we don't expect these improvements in the debt burden or 'debt affordability' to be enough to trigger a sovereign rating upgrade at this time.”Moody’s currently rates India at “Baa3” with a stable outlook, the lowest investment-grade rating. It maintains that further reductions in the debt burden and revenue-enhancing measures are essential for an upgrade.In her latest budget, Sitharaman set the fiscal deficit at 4.8% of GDP for the current year, aligning with previous commitments. She outlined a glide path to reduce it to 4.4% in 2025-26, with a long-term target of lowering debt as a percentage of GDP.She explained, “Equally to give a long-term perspective, we have said that we will manage our debt in such a way that the debt-to-GDP ratio will be continuously reduced as outlined in an expert committee report.”Sitharaman highlighted that India’s fiscal strategy differs from that of many advanced economies. “I'm not comparing my size with any advanced country. But in terms of the principle, cutting down debt to GDP, maintaining fiscal deficit—these are relentlessly being followed without any negative impact on social welfare schemes, education, or health,” she said.Infrastructure remains a core focus under the PM Gati Shakti initiative. Sitharaman reaffirmed significant capital expenditure allocations for roads, railways, and ports to enhance connectivity and support long-term economic growth.She also highlighted the progress of the National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP), noting that asset monetisation is generating revenue for reinvestment into new projects. Additionally, the government is encouraging public-private partnerships to attract further investments into key sectors.Sitharaman expressed confidence in the stability of the banking sector, citing improved asset quality and strong credit growth. She noted that non-performing assets (NPAs) have significantly declined, and recapitalisation measures have strengthened public sector banks.She emphasised that increased lending to MSMEs and the corporate sector is crucial for sustaining economic momentum. Government-backed credit guarantee schemes have supported small businesses, while financial sector reforms aim to enhance credit flow further.The ‘Make in India’ and Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes continue to drive industrial growth. Sitharaman highlighted their role in expanding India’s manufacturing sector, particularly in electronics, pharmaceuticals, and auto components.India is emerging as a global manufacturing hub, with supply chain diversification prompting more companies to set up operations. Labour reforms and ease-of-doing-business measures continue to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) into key industries.The finance minister reiterated the government’s commitment to farmers, focusing on boosting productivity, ensuring price stability, and improving rural infrastructure. She highlighted schemes such as PM-KISAN and increased budget allocations for agricultural research and irrigation.She also pointed to agri-tech innovations and digital platforms as transformative elements in modernising India’s farming sector. The government is actively collaborating with states to enhance market linkages and improve farmers' incomes.On taxation, Sitharaman assured that reforms will continue to enhance transparency and compliance. The Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime has stabilised, with strong collections reflecting robust economic activity.She noted that corporate tax reductions have boosted investments, and simplification of tax procedures remains a priority to encourage entrepreneurship and business expansion.Sitharaman acknowledged inflationary pressures but assured that the government, in coordination with the Reserve Bank of India RBI ), is actively managing price stability. Measures such as reduced import duties on essential commodities and increased domestic production are helping control inflation.She stressed that inflation remains within manageable limits, with periodic interventions in food prices to protect consumers from volatility.Sitharaman underscored the importance of digitalisation in India’s economic expansion, citing the success of UPI , fintech innovations, and digital governance. The government is prioritising artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain , and data-driven policymaking to position India as a leader in the digital economy.She also highlighted efforts to strengthen cybersecurity and data protection, ensuring the resilience of India’s digital infrastructure.Sitharaman reassured that the government has not compromised on public expenditure necessary to spur growth. “The capital expenditure has not come down. We follow the two cardinal principles: to keep your fiscal deficit under check and to borrow only for meaningful capital expenditure,” she said.She justified the modest increase in capital spending for the next financial year at Rs 11.21 lakh crore, compared to the revised estimate of Rs 10.18 lakh crore in the current fiscal. “The quality of spending is also to be seen,” she noted.Reflecting on the previous year, Sitharaman acknowledged that election-related activities had slowed capital expenditure. “During that year, the election year, the capital expenditure did go a bit slow. Otherwise, my revised estimate would have also been closer to the budget estimate number again,” she added.","Nirmala Sitharaman outlined India’s economic trajectory, fiscal policies, and key government initiatives.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday launched a sharp attack on the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) saying that the party is falling apart ahead of the upcoming elections in Delhi.“We are seeing that even before the voting, ‘jhaadu ke tinke bikhar rahe hain’ (the straws of the broom are scattering). Leaders of ‘AAP-da’ are leaving it, they know that people are angry with ‘AAP-da’, they (people) hate this party,” Modi said, referring to several AAP leaders quitting the party.He also expressed confidence in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) forming the next government in Delhi.“With the arrival of Basant Panchami, the weather starts to change.

In my entire political life, I haven’t seen a budget with so many projects and schemes for every sector,” said Sachdeva.BJP MP Manoj Tiwari too highlighted the decision to exempt income tax on earnings up to Rs 12 lakh. “No tax on an income of up to Rs 12 lakh is a big help for the middle class.

The complaint, lodged by Muzaffarpur-based lawyer Sudhir Ojha, accuses them of disrespecting India's highest constitutional authority and seeks legal action under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS).The case will be heard in a Bihar court on 10 February.The controversy erupted following Sonia Gandhi’s comment after the President’s address to Parliament to mark the beginning of the Budget session. Speaking to reporters, the former Congress chief remarked, “The President was getting very tired by the end… she could hardly speak, poor thing.” Rahul Gandhi, in a separate clip, dismissed the speech as “boring,” while Priyanka Gandhi Vadra was also present during the exchange.The Rashtrapati Bhavan responded strongly, calling the remarks “unacceptable” and asserting that Murmu was not tired. In an official statement, the President’s office said, “Some prominent leaders of the Congress party have made comments that clearly hurt the dignity of the high office, and therefore are unacceptable.” The statement further clarified that Murmu was fully composed throughout her speech and that speaking for marginalised communities “can never be tiring.”The remarks triggered a sharp political backlash, with the BJP launching an all-out attack against the Congress. Prime Minister Narendra Modi accused the party’s “shahi parivar” (royal family) of insulting Murmu, a tribal leader. Speaking at a rally in Delhi, he said, “One member called her speech ‘boring,’ and another went further, calling her ‘poor’ and ‘tired.’ This is an insult to 10 crore tribal brothers and sisters and every poor person who has risen from the ground.” BJP chief JP Nadda also criticised Sonia Gandhi’s choice of words, calling them “deeply disrespectful.”Several NDA ministers demanded an apology from Sonia Gandhi, with Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju leading the charge. “The Congress must apologise to the nation and the President for this insult,” Rijiju said.Congress leaders, however, defended Sonia Gandhi, alleging that the BJP was twisting her words for political gain. Party president Mallikarjun Kharge countered by pointing out that the government had disrespected President Murmu by not inviting her to the inauguration of the new Parliament building and the Ram temple in Ayodhya. “The BJP had deliberately kept our current President and the previous President away from these historic moments,” Kharge said.Priyanka Gandhi also came to her mother’s defence, insisting that Sonia Gandhi had the “utmost respect” for Murmu and that her comments were being misrepresented. “My mother simply said that the President must have been tired after such a long speech. It is unfortunate that the media twisted her words,” she stated.As the political storm intensifies, the Bihar court’s decision on 10 February will determine the legal course of action against the Congress leaders. Meanwhile, the controversy continues to be a focal point in the BJP’s ongoing campaign against the opposition.","Complaint filed against Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra.

I am 25 years old. Last year, I went to Bengaluru for my studies, where I didn’t have many people to talk to or hang out with. I am an extrovert, but after going there, I felt quite lonely. The course too was very tough. There were 14 students, and all of them were Hindi-speaking. I was the only Tamil. Apart from that, the girls in my class also used to talk behind my back very badly. I tried to be friends with them but they saw me as an alien. This led to the development of

self-esteem issues

in me. Now, this stress is making me depressed and I often shout at people in my house and also become very aggressive. I don’t have a job and I am also worried about unemployment. I am trying to fix my sleep schedule, but not being able to. Please help.

When people talk to me, I am often unable to express myself. I like to be alone but sometimes I feel very lonely as nobody is there to talk to freely and with whom I share my problems. I don’t understand whom to trust. Please help.

I am a 50-year-old IT professional struggling with restlessness, overthinking, and anxiety. I often find myself disconnected from the present, lost in my thoughts or worried about incidents that did not meet my expectations.For example, I often dwell on arguments with co-workers or my boss. When I don’t meet a goal, I overthink about how I will handle challenging future assignments. These feelings intensify during periods of work-related stress or conflict. At home, my restless mind causes me to speak loudly, which frustrates my family. I also tend to engage in a lot of self-talk, replaying scenarios in my mind and imagining how I could have acted differently or better or given a better response when people have pinned me down. How can I manage these challenges in a better manner?It’s understandable to feel restless and consumed by thoughts, especially when work stress and expectations weigh heavily. Your mind is trying to protect you by replaying past situations and preparing for future challenges, but this overactivity is leaving you drained and disconnected. Acknowledging this struggle is the first step towards managing it. Try grounding yourself in the present to break the cycle of overthinking. A simple technique is the 5-4-3-2-1 method: notice five things you see, four you feel, three sounds, two scents, and one taste. This pulls you back from mental loops. When self-talk becomes overwhelming, schedule “worry time” — set aside 10 to 15 minutes daily to reflect, then redirect your focus. At home, practice pausing before responding, consciously lowering your voice. This can create a calmer atmosphere for both you and your family. If these thoughts feel too consuming, professional guidance can provide tailored strategies. Small and mindful adjustments can create a lasting difference.Feeling isolated, unaccepted, and struggling with self-worth is painful, especially when you’re naturally social. It makes sense that this experience left a lasting impact. Being in a space where you feel excluded and judged can shake anyone’s confidence. Now, with job uncertainty and disrupted sleep, it’s understandable that frustration is spilling over at home. Start by regaining control where you can. Structure your day — wake up at a set time, engage in small productive tasks, and set short-term job-search goals. Even sending one application or improving your resume daily is progress. For self-esteem, focus on people who uplift you. Reconnect with those who make you feel seen. Remind yourself that rejection from a few doesn’t define your worth. When anger rises, pause and breathe before responding. If sleep is an issue, reduce screen time before bed and try winding down with music or a book. If these feelings persist, talking to someone (professionally or personally) can help. You’re not alone in this, and things can improve with small steps.It sounds like you’re carrying a lot inside, and that can feel heavy. Wanting to express yourself but struggling to do so can be frustrating, and loneliness only makes it harder. It’s okay to feel this way, you’re not alone. Many people experience this and it doesn’t mean something is wrong with you. Start by giving yourself space to process. Writing down your thoughts or expressing them through art or music can be a gentle first step. If conversations feel difficult, try sharing small thoughts with someone you trust. Trust is built over time, not overnight. Loneliness doesn’t always mean a lack of people but rather a lack of connection. Seek small and meaningful interactions in safe spaces. Maybe a hobby, an online community or even a support group can help. You don’t have to do this alone. If it feels overwhelming, talking to a mental health care professional can help you navigate these emotions in a supportive and non-judgemental way. Remember that you deserve to be heard. Start small, and over a period of time, connections will follow.","This week’s advice is from counselling psychologist Bindhu Subhash — Anonymous.
